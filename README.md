ðŸš¨ Violent Crime Risk Prediction (India)
This project implements an end-to-end Machine Learning pipeline to predict the probability of a reported incident falling under the Violent Crime domain based on situational, geographical, and temporal features.
The prediction model is deployed via a Streamlit web application for real-time risk assessment.

ðŸš€ How to Run the Application
Prerequisites
Clone the Repository:
git clone [YOUR REPO URL]
cd [YOUR REPO FOLDER NAME]


Install Dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt


Step 1: Train the Model
The model must be trained first to create the models/crime_predictor_model.joblib file.
Ensure crime_data.csv is in the data/raw folder.
Run the cells in 01_Data_Cleaning_and_Geocoding.ipynb.
Run the cells in 02_Model_Training_and_Evaluation.ipynb (This saves the model file).
Step 2: Launch the Streamlit App
Once the model file is generated, navigate to the project root and launch the app:
streamlit run app/app.py


The application will open in your web browser, allowing you to interact with the model and generate predictions.
